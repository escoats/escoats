## Hi, I'm Lizzie! ðŸŒ¸

I'm a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, expecting to graduate in May 2027. I'm a Computer Science and Information Science double major, with a minor in Data Science.

I'm pursuing full-stack software development, and I'm passionate about human-centered design and prioritizing the user above all.
